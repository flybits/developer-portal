# Android SDK Release Notes for 0.9.1

As this is the initial release of the new Flybits SDKs for Version 3 of the platform, we have revamped much of the SDK architecture including many of classes and methods. Additionally, we have now split the SDKs into 3 different SDKs including one for push, context, and kernel. The full documentation for all 3 SDKs can be found [here](https://devportal.flybits.com/#/documentation/android/getting-started/setup), to simply implement the SDKs, the gradle dependencies are shown below.
